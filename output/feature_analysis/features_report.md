# Feature Engineering and Analysis Report

## Overview

This report documents the process and rationale behind the feature engineering pipeline for wallet-level fraud detection, as well as the results of feature analysis and visualization. The goal is to build a rich, interpretable set of features that capture both basic activity and complex risk signals, and to ensure these features are high-quality and informative for downstream machine learning models.

## Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 1. build_features_l0_aggregate.py

**Purpose:**  
Computes basic, aggregate statistics for each wallet.  
These are "raw" features, providing a baseline for all further analysis.

**Why L0?**  
L0 features are foundational: simple counts, sums, and averages that describe overall wallet activity.  
They establish a baseline for what is "normal" or "typical" for a wallet.

**How are features computed?**  
Reads all transactions.  
For each wallet:
- Counts total transactions.
- Sums and averages transaction values.
- Calculates wallet age (time between first and last transaction).
- Counts unique counterparties (from and to).
- Counts "circular" transactions (where from and to are the same wallet).
- Counts "dormant awakenings" (gaps >30 days between transactions).
- Assigns a label (if available).

**Output:**  
A CSV with one row per wallet.

### 2. build_features_l1_behavior.py

**Purpose:**  
Extracts behavioral patterns from transaction histories.

**Why L1?**  
L1 features go beyond simple aggregates to capture patterns over time, such as bursts of activity, dormancy, and error rates.  
These features help identify unusual or risky behaviors that arenâ€™t visible from raw counts alone.

**How are features computed?**  
Reads all transactions, sorts by wallet and time.  
For each wallet:
- Calculates time differences between transactions.
- Computes:
    - Burst transaction ratio (fraction of transactions occurring within 1 hour of the previous).
    - Dormant awaken count (number of times a wallet is inactive for >30 days).
    - Failure ratio (fraction of failed transactions).

**Output:**  
A CSV with one row per wallet.

### 3. build_features_l2_riskflags.py

**Purpose:**  
Flags wallets based on their interactions with known risky counterparties.

**Why L2?**  
L2 features use information about the network of wallets, not just individual behavior.  
They quantify risk by association: how many times a wallet interacts with "fraud", "suspicious", or "normal" wallets.

**How are features computed?**  
Reads all transactions and L1 features.  
For each wallet:
- Counts how many times it interacts with wallets labeled as "fraud", "suspicious", or "normal".
- Merges these counts with L1 features.

**Output:**  
A CSV with one row per wallet.

### 4. build_features_l3_metaai.py

**Purpose:**  
Applies machine learning to detect anomalies and cluster wallets.  
Combines multiple signals into a single risk tag.

**Why L3?**  
L3 features use advanced analytics (ML models) to find subtle, complex patterns that may indicate risk.  
They synthesize lower-level features into higher-level, more actionable insights.

**How are features computed?**  
Reads L2 features.  
Normalizes numeric features.  
Runs:
- Isolation Forest (anomaly detection).
- DBSCAN (density-based clustering, flags outliers).
Creates a "combined risk tag" if any of the following are true:
- Many fraud/suspicious counterparties.
- Detected as anomaly by ML models.

**Output:**  
A CSV with all features and risk tags.

### 5. build_features_l3_xai_tags.py

**Purpose:**  
Adds XAI tags to each wallet, making risk reasons human-readable.

**Why?**  
XAI tags help users understand why a wallet is flagged as risky.  
They translate complex model outputs and feature combinations into simple, interpretable reason codes.

**How are features computed?**  
Reads L3 MetaAI features.  
Sets boolean flags for:
- Burst transaction behavior.
- Dormant awakening.
- Counterparty fraud links.
- Anomaly detection.
- High failure rate.
Generates a reason code string (e.g., "burst_tx|fraud_link").  
Adds a final XAI flag (true if any risk reason is present).

**Output:**  
A CSV with all features and XAI tags.

## Feature Analysis and Visualization

After building the features, we performed a thorough analysis to ensure data quality and to understand which features are most informative.

### **Summary of Analysis Results**

- **No missing values** in any feature columns.
- **No low-variance features** (all features have enough variation to be useful).
- **Highly correlated features:** Only `anomaly_dbscan` and `anomaly_flag` are almost perfectly correlated, suggesting one can be dropped to avoid redundancy.

### **Insights from Visualizations**

#### **1. Correlation Heatmap**
- The heatmap shows how features relate to each other.
- Most features are not strongly correlated, indicating a diverse set of predictors.
- The only strong correlation is between `anomaly_dbscan` and `anomaly_flag`, confirming redundancy.

#### **2. KDE Plots by Label**
- These plots show the distribution of key features for each class (fraud, normal, suspicious).
- Features like `total_transactions`, `burst_tx_ratio`, and `num_fraud_counterparties` show clear separation between classes, making them valuable for classification.
- Some features have overlapping distributions, indicating they may be less useful for distinguishing classes.

## **Conclusion**

- The feature engineering pipeline produces a comprehensive, multi-level set of features for each wallet, capturing both basic activity and complex risk signals.
- Feature analysis confirms the data is clean, non-redundant (except for one pair), and contains features that are informative for fraud detection.
- Visualizations support these findings and help guide feature selection for modeling.
- The final feature set is well-prepared for use in machine learning models, including GNNs and classical classifiers.
